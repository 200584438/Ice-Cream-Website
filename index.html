            <h2>History of Vanilla Ice Cream</h2>
            <p>Vanilla was first used by the Mexica and brought to Spain by conquistadors in the 1510s. Initially used to flavor chocolate drinks, vanilla eventually became an independent flavor in Europe. Vanilla ice cream recipes appeared in France in the early 18th century, and Thomas Jefferson introduced the flavor to the United States.</p>
            <p>By the middle of the 18th century, the French had enhanced ice cream by adding egg yolks to the recipe, creating a smoother and richer texture. Jeffersonâ€™s recipe for vanilla ice cream is preserved at the Library of Congress.</p>
